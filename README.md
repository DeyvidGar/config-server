# Config server

## Description

<p>Spring cloud config is a microservices configuration server that facilitates the configuration of the microservices.</p>

<p>By default Spring Cloud config uses Github as a repository to centralize the configuration of each service or by indicating through a local repository indicating the path.</p>

<p>You can able to configure the remote repositories in github in the application.properties:</p>

```java
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=https://github.com/DeyvidGar/config-repository-microservices.git
spring.cloud.config.server.git.clone-on-start=true
spring.cloud.config.server.git.default-label=main
```

<p>In spring boot project we can implement this architecture microservices server using the dependencies:</p>

1. **Config server**

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeyvidGar/assets/master/Config-server.png)

## Endpoints

- To retrieve the repositories for the microservices.

>**GET**: localhost:8888

## Configuration

<p>This projects was builds with the next dependencies:</p>

- **Spring-boot 3.2.3**
- **Springframework 6.1.4**
- **Config server**

## Instruction to work with Microservice architecture

### 1. Discovery server

<p>In first instance we need to start up is discovery server, in spring we need a project with eureka server.</p>

<p>You can clone the repository:</p>

```console
https://github.com/DeyvidGar/discovery-server.git
```

### 2. Config server

<p>The second instance we need to start up is config server, in spring we need a project with config server.</p>

<p>You can clone the repository:</p>

```console
https://github.com/DeyvidGar/config-server.git
```

### 3. Config repository

<p>The thrid step is locate or create a remote repository in github that represent an centralized configuration files.</p>

<p>You can use the repository:</p>

```console
https://github.com/DeyvidGar/config-repository-microservices.git
```

### 4. Start up microservices

<p>Finally steps is create the microservice apps, for example you can clone the artifact of a microservice.</p>

<p>You can clone the repository:</p>

```console
https://github.com/DeyvidGar/initial-artifact-microservice.git
```

### 5. Start up Gateway

<p>Finally steps is create the microservice apps, for example you can clone the artifact of a microservice.</p>

<p>You can clone the repository:</p>

```console
https://github.com/DeyvidGar/api-gateway.git
```


## What i need?

<p>You need to have installed:<p>

- Java 17 or >
- Mysql
- Maven.
- Intellij IDE.
- Eclipse or STS IDE.
- Enable Lombok annotation.

## What run the application?

### For Git bash windows console

<p>We can run the application in console following the next steps:</p>

<p>First ensure the path variable in JAVA_HOME should be 17.</p>

1. To find all paths environment variables.

```console
env
```

2. Of only get the JAVA_HOME value.

```console
echo JAVA_HOME
```

3. Now set the route of your jdk-17.

```console
export JAVA_HOME='C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17'
```

4. Recommended execute the next command to ensure that the correct running.

```console
mvn clean install
```

5. Finally execute the command to start spring boot application.

```console
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### For Intellij IDE

<p>We can run the application in intellij following the next steps:</p>

> 1. Find the main class in com.deyvis.initialartifactms.InitialArtifactMsApplication.java

> 2. Right click and Run 'InitialArtifactMsApplication.main()'

### For Eclipse or STS IDE

<p>We can run the application in Eclipse following the next steps:</p>

> 1. Find in the package explorer this proyect

> 2. Right click and Run as -> Spring boot application.
